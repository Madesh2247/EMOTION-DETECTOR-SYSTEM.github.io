This project presents an Emotion Detector System using Raspberry Pi that
can identify human emotions in real-time using facial expression analysis.
The system captures facial images through a Pi Camera, processes them
using OpenCV and a pre-trained deep learning model (FER – Facial
Emotion Recognition), and classifies emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry,
Surprise, Neutral, Fear, and Disgust. The Raspberry Pi serves as an
affordable embedded platform for running the model efficiently. This system
has applications in human-computer interaction, security monitoring,
education, and healthcare. It demonstrates real-time emotion recognition
capabilities using lightweight, low-cost hardware.
